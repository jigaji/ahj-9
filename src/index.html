          I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
          For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
          I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
          When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
          
          Tell you you're the greatest
          But once you turn, they hate us
          
          Oh, the misery
          Everybody wants to be my enemy
          Spare the sympathy
          Everybody wants to be my enemy
          (Look out for yourself)
          My enemy
          (Look out for yourself)
          But I'm ready
